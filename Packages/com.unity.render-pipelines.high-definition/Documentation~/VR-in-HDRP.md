# Virtual Reality in the High Definition Render Pipeline

To use Virtual Reality (VR) in HDRP, you must enable VR in your Unity Project. To do this, see the [VR tab](#Render-Pipeline-Wizard.html#VRTab) in the Render Pipeline Wizard.

Some HDRP features are not compatible with VR. When you enable VR in your Project, HDRP automatically disables the features that it does not support . If you encounter an issue with a specific feature, you can disable it in your Projectâ€™s [HDRP Asset](HDRP-Asset.html).
