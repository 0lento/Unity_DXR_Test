# High Definition RP Configuration

The High definition RP Configuration package contains configuration files for the High Definition Render Pipeline.
Users who need to change the pipeline configuration need to use this package as a local package and make the necessary changes to the configuration files.

See https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest/index.html for documentation on the High Definition Render Pipeline itself.
